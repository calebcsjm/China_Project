## CCP Perspectives on the Economy

Analysis of Qiushi and economic data gives insights to some interesting trends on how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) talks about the economy. 

### Importance

One proxy for importance is the frequency with which a term appears in the text. The following images provide some intuition:

As we from the first graph, the economy has a relatively strong presence, with an average of 752 appearances over the course of a quarter, which usually consist of about 115 articles. 

It is talked about more frequently than the U.S., the PRC's primary rival, and rising slogans like "High-Quality Development." It is at times surpassed by super hot topics, like "pandemic" right after COVID-19 first appeared, but other than that it always seems to stay ahead of other topical issues. This is not suprising - anecdotal experience that this would be true in any nation. 

### Outlook

Most readers likely know that the Chinese economy has been dealing with a number of challenges in recent years: the struggling housing market, local governments with high levels of debt, low levels of consumption, shifting demographics, etc. How has the CCP responded to these challenges? Is the investors pessimism reflected in official narratives? As the graph below shows, the opposite is the case.

These graph was generated by isolating every sentence that had the word "经济" (economy) in it, analyzing the sentiment of that sentence with a NLP model (based on BERT), and than averging that sentiment first across the article and then the quarter. Different methodologies could result in different absolute estimates of the sentiment, but with a consistent method we can be reasonable constant about their relative presence and trend. 

The graph indicates that that not only are officially-presented attitudes about the economy mostly positive, but the CCP rhetoric about the economy has actually gotten more postive as they descend further into their current struggles. 

However, there does appear to be a correlation between economic performance and the frequency of economic discussion in the articles. This suggests that, while they present a postive outlook, they may simply talk less about the economy when it is not performing well. 

First, consider the graph of instances of "economy" in a given quarter against the percent change of GDP of that quarter relative to the previous quarter.

In this graph, it seems like GDP growth and discussion of economy are going in the opposite direction. It is difficult to quantify what we see visually, but the correlation coefficient between the two is -0.52, indicating that they move in the opposite direction. 

However, the authors of the articles do not know what the net GDP growth for that quarter will be until it is over - it is in someways an unknown. But they can react and adjust to the previous quarter's economic growth. Hence, we consider the discussion of the economy with the economic growth in the previous quarter.

Making this adjustment, the graphs start to line up, with especially noticable and similar jumps at 2020 Q2 and 2021 Q2. The correlation coefficient flips, and now reflects a postive correlation, with reduced magnitude. This positive correlation means that when the economy does poorly, the CCP talks about the economy less, and when it does well, they talk about it more. We cannot show that this is a casual relationship, but they do trend together.
